            Jesus, you smoke too? Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. It's
            cold, damn
            cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still
            ticking.
            Why not? Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?
        </p>
        <p>
            Yeah. Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed any blindspot before when I would drive it. Hi, son. Wait a
            minute, what are
            you doing, Doc? Uh, look me up when you get there. What about George?
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't stop, Wilbert, drive. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this,
            that's where
            they kiss for the first time. Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of-
            Oh, pleased
            to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual
            coming up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breakfast. Hot, Jesus Christ, Doc. Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein. Leave me alone. Oh, uh,
            hey you, get
            your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear? Hello, hello, anybody home? Think, McFly,
            think. I gotta
            have time to recopy it. Do your realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd
            get kicked
            out of school. You wouldn't want that to happen would you, would you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Right about here. Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. The flux capacitor. whoa, this is it, this
            is the part
            coming up, Doc. Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where
            I come from.
            Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off? Listen, I gotta go but I
            wanted to
            tell you that it's been educational. Doc? Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett
            Brown,
            McFly? Tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you McFly I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me
            give you a
            nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called Doctor Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang
            around with
            him you're gonna end up in big trouble. Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear
            before, Calvin.
            Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload. Leave her alone, you bastard. Alright, take
            it up, go.
            Doc. I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number. Bye. Alright, we're the pinheads.
        </p>
        <p>
            C'mon, c'mon. I hope so. Quiet. This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously
            infatuated with
            you instead of your father. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it.
