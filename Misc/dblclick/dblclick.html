            Shields up! Rrrrred alert! A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to
            you. We have
            a saboteur aboard. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Could someone survive inside
            a
            transporter buffer for 75 years? Ensign Babyface! Did you come here for something in particular or just
            general
            Riker-bashing? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Yesterday I did not
            know how to
            eat gagh. Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a
            little
            frayed on the ship lately? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? and attack the Romulans.
            This is not
            about revenge. This is about justice. Your head is not an artifact!
