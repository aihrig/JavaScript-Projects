### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu to order a pizza with various toppings and calculates the price for the order.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. It randomly rolls the dice to select which of the two players goes first and then the game begins. Players can decide which token to use and the winner is celebrated with fun sounds.

### Calculator
A basic four function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
